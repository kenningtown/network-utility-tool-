Instructions:

1. Click the “Run” button on network_utility.py
2. The menu will appear in a new window. You have 6 options to choose from, if you want to exit right away, you click the “Exit”.
3. If you click the DNS Lookup, you are then asked to provide url and then the command out of (nslookup, host, dig). After that, it will display the response in a new window.
4. In traceroute, you just provide url. Then, it will provide traceroute info and tracepath response in a new window. This might take up to 1-1.5 minutes to wait, but it finally executes, so I ask you to wait a little bit.
5. In FTP, you are asked to provide server, port, username and password. This information helps to establish a connection.
6. HTTP GET request, asks you to provide the URL, and it will provide a response in a new window.
7. Socket communication firstly asks a user for the message to send from client to the server. Then it asks for the port and choice between TCP and UDP. Server response will appear in a new window.
8. You can check my other two py files to make sure everything works fine without the GUI as well.

Note: If any of the operations do not respond instantly, I ask you to wait at least for 1.5 minutes. Everything is executable, according to my check.
